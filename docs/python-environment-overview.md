# Python environment overview

## Python files
There are two basic file types for working with python code:
- Plain text files with extension `*.py`
- [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) files with extension `*.ipynb`

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Although it is entirely possbile to edit and run python code using only a simple text editor and the command line, an IDE can make coding a more pleasent experience.

A few recommended IDEs:
- [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org)
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)

## Package managers
In this course we will primarily use `conda` and `pip` to manage python packages. `conda` also allows you to manage `python` as a package, and for each `python` version that you install you can still use `pip` as well if you want.

- `conda` (e.g., [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)) <-- Also manages `python` and `pip` as packages in conda.
- `pip`: [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org) <-- Tied to a particular installation of `python`.

There are a plethora of other package managers out there, but `conda` and `pip` are probably the most widely used. That said, [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a more modern package manager that is growing in popularity. You are welcome to use `uv` if you'd like, but you will have to look into that on your own.

## Python Environments
You can think of a python environment as a folder that contains a particular version of python and a set of python packages that you installed into the environment. The key point is that you can have multiple python environments on your computer and each environment is completely separate from all other environments. Thus, each environment can have a different set of installed packages and even a completely different version of python.

Why should you almost always use a separate python environment for each project?
1. Different projects may require packages that are incompatible with each other.
2. The more packages you install into a single environment, the more you risk having a package dependency error. It is not a question of *if* this will happen, it is a question of *when*. Thus, you are asking for trouble if you keep installing all of the packages that you need for all of your projects into the same environment. If dependencies in an environment become sufficiently convoluted, you may need to simply delete the environment and remake it from scratch. If you have a separate environment for each project, this won't affect all your other projects.
3. The more packages you install into a single environment, the more work a package manager has to do to figure out dependencies when installing new packages. This makes installing new packages slower.

In this course we'll use `conda` to manage our python environments:
- conda environments (e.g., neu365p as in the [setup instructions](setup-your-python-environment.md))

There are a lot (too many) of python environment managers out there such as [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) or [venv](https://python.land/virtual-environments/virtualenv), but `conda` is a widely used all-purpose option that allows managing python versions as well as packages. [A slightly outdated blog on python package/environment tools with nice Venn diagrams.](https://alpopkes.com/posts/python/packaging_tools/) I recommend checking out [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) if you prefer something other than `conda` and `pip`.
